As we approach [World Asthma
Day](https://ginasthma.org/world-asthma-day-may-7-2024/), which is
observed each year on the first Tuesday in May, I decided explore the
data within the [Medical Expenditure Panel
Survey](https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/)â€™s public use files to learn more
about asthma, the populations most affected by asthma, and the costs
associated with treating asthma. The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey
(MEPS) is conducted on an ongoing basis by the Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality and offers comprehensive data on healthcare use and
expenditures in the U.S., providing invaluable insights into public
health trends, including asthma.

Here are four key things I learned about asthma in the US, alongside
visualizations based on MEPS data that do some light visual analysis and
data storytelling.

### 1. Asthma affects men and women differently across age groups.

### 2. Socioeconomic factors have an influence on rates of asthma prevalence.

### 3. Asthma prevalence rates vary across populations with differing racial and ethnic identities.

### 4. Individuals with a current or previous asthma diagnosis have higher healthcare expenses, on average, than individuals who have never received an asthma diagnosis.
